## 🚀 Overview

HireSense AI transforms the recruitment process. Instead of manually reading hundreds of resumes, recruiters can upload resumes and job descriptions, and the platform automatically extracts structured data, calculates ATS match scores, and ranks the best candidates.

## ✨ Features

- **Intelligent Parsing**: Extracts skills, experience, and education from PDFs and DOCX files using spaCy and Gemini.
- **Semantic Match Scoring**: Calculates compatibility between resumes and job descriptions using Sentence-Transformers.
- **Candidate Ranking Dashboard**: A highly polished, responsive UI to manage and filter top talent.
- **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, and strict file upload validation.
- **Platform Analytics**: Real-time metrics on parsing success, candidate pipelines, and system health.

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory:
- [Architecture & System Design](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Database ER Diagram](docs/DATABASE.md)
- [API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)
- [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

## ⚡ Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run HireSense AI locally is via Docker.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hiresense-ai.git
cd hiresense-ai

# Set up environment variables
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# Required for backend Firebase token verification.
# Put the service-account JSON on one line in your shell environment or .env:
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account",...}'
# Alternatively set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS to a mounted JSON file path.

# Build and start the containers
docker compose up --build -d
```
The Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:80` and the Backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.

To stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

PostgreSQL data, uploaded resumes, and backend logs are kept in Docker volumes. Use
`docker compose down -v` only when you intentionally want to delete that local data.

## 🔒 Security & Performance
- **A+ Security**: Implements `slowapi` rate limiting, strict CORS, `nosniff` headers, and XSS protection.
- **Optimized**: Utilizes React `Suspense` for code splitting and Nginx Gzip compression for lightning-fast loads.
